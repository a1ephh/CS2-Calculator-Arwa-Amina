# CS2-Calculator-Arwa-Amina


The purpose of this project, and by extension this repository, is to prototype a working calculator with the functionality of basic arithmetics, factorial calculation, a greatest common divisor (GCD), a least common multiple (LCM) and a random number generator. This repository includes

1.) calculator.h - a header file that has the declarations of all the included functions

2.) calculator.cpp - a cpp file with all the function definitions 

3.) test.cpp - a file that calls all the functions and allows the user to use the calculator 

4.) the cmake files that allow the calculator to run on any computer. 

This project is the work of Arwa Hassan and Amina Elshafei for submission in assignment 1 in CS2 lab to Dr. Kryellos.
